Question:
Write a program to find the nth term in the Fibonacci series using recursion. Note that the first 2 terms in the Fibonacci Series are 0 and 1.
Input and Output Format: 

Input consists of an integer.

Refer sample input and output for formatting specifications.

All text in bold corresponds to input and the rest corresponds to output.

 

Sample Input and Output:

Sample Output:

The term 4 in the fibonacci series is 2


Solution:

import java.util.Scanner;
class Main
{
    public static void main(String args[])
    {
        int n,result;
        Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);
        n=sc.nextInt();
        result=fibo(n);
        System.out.println("The term "+n+" in the fibonacci series is "+result);
        
    }
    static int fibo(int n)
    {
        if(n==1)
        {
            return 0;
        }
        else if(n==2)
        {
            return 1;
        }
        else
        {
            return (fibo(n-1)+fibo(n-2));
        }
    }
}
