Question:
Write a program to find the nth term in the Fibonacci series using recursion. Note that the first 2 terms in the Fibonacci Series are 0 and 1.
Input and Output Format: 

Input consists of an integer.

Refer sample input and output for formatting specifications.

All text in bold corresponds to input and the rest corresponds to output.

 

Sample Input and Output:

4



Sample Output:

The term 4 in the fibonacci series is 2


Solution:
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {

    private static int fibonacci(int n) {
        if (n <= 0) {
            return 0;
        } else if (n == 1) {
            return 1;
        }
        
        return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2);
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int n = scanner.nextInt();
        
        int nthTerm = fibonacci(n);
        System.out.println("The term " + n + " in the fibonacci series is " + nthTerm);
    }
}
