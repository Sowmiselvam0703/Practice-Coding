Write a program to compute the factorial of a number using recursion.


Input Format:

Input consists of an integer.



Output Format:

Print the factorial of the given number

Refer sample input and output for formatting specifications. 



Sample Input:

5



Sample Output:

The factorial of 5 is 120

Solution:
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {

    private static int computeFactorial(int n) {
        if (n == 0 || n == 1) {
            return 1;
        }
        
        return n * computeFactorial(n - 1);
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int num = scanner.nextInt();
        
        int factorial = computeFactorial(num);
        System.out.println("The factorial of " + num  +" is "+ factorial);
    }
}
