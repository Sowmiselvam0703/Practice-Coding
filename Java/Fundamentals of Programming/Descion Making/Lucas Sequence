a = 0, b=0, c=1 are the 1st three terms. All other terms in the Lucas sequence are generated by the sum of their 3 most recent predecessors. Write a program to generate the first n terms of a Lucas Sequence.
Input format:

The input containing an integer 'n' which denotes the given number



Output format:

Print the 'n' terms of the Lucas Sequence, separated by a single space. There are no leading or trailing spaces in the output.



Sample Input:

5



Sample Output:

0 0 1 1 2

Solution:

import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main{
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int n = scanner.nextInt();

        int[] sequence = generateLucasSequence(n);

        // Print the sequence
        for (int term : sequence) {
            System.out.print(term + " ");
        }
    }

    public static int[] generateLucasSequence(int n) {
        if (n <= 0) {
            return new int[0];
        }

        int[] sequence = new int[n];
        sequence[0] = 0;
        if (n > 1) {
            sequence[1] = 0;
        }
        if (n > 2) {
            sequence[2] = 1;
        }

        for (int i = 3; i < n; i++) {
            sequence[i] = sequence[i - 1] + sequence[i - 2] + sequence[i - 3];
        }

        return sequence;
    }
}
