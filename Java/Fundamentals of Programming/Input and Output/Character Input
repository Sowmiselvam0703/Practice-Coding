Question:
  Two commonly used functions for I/O (Input/Output) are System.out.println() and System.in(). Write a program to get a character as input and print it. The Scanner class reads formatted input from the keyboard. When the user enters a character, it is stored in the variable test character.

Sample Input:
  z

Sample Output:
  z


Solution:

import java.util.Scanner;
class Main
{
    public static void main(String args[])
    {
        //fill the code;
      Scanner sa = new Scanner(System.in);
      char a = sa.next().charAt(0);
      System.out.println(a);
    }
}
