Input format:
Input consist of 2 integers

The first input corresponds to the first number(x)

The second input corresponds to the second number(y)

Sample Input:

6

8



Sample Output:

6 less than 8


Solution:

import java.util.Scanner;
class Main
{
    public static void main(String args[])
    {
        // fill the code;
      Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
      int a = sc.nextInt();
      int b = sc.nextInt();
      if(a>b){
        System.out.print(a+" greater than "+b);
      }
      else if(a<b){
        System.out.print(a+" less than "+b);
      }
      else{
        System.out.print(a+" and "+b+" are equal");
      }
    }
}
